# cowboy-album
HTML/CSS landing page for a fictional music artist and their new album.

This simple webpage gave me the opportunity to practice my skills with HTML and CSS. My plan was to structure the page in sections and initially greet the user with both a social media navigation bar and the artist photo in full view. I also incorporated a slow fade-in animation.

I used stock photos and AI for the imagery, making additional edits using Photoshop.
